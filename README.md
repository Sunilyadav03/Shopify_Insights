**What is a line item?**
A line item represents a specific product or service that is included in a purchase. It typically includes information like the product name, quantity, price, and any variations or customizations made to it. 

**How line items relate to orders:**
An order can contain multiple line items, each representing a different product or quantity of the same product the customer has added to their cart. 

**"Line items per order" in Shopify:**
When discussing limits or restrictions on line items, the phrase "line items per order" refers to the maximum number of individual products that can be included in a single order, often within a specific context, such as a Shopify store or an API connection. 

**Example:**
If a customer buys 2 shirts and 1 pair of pants, the order would have 3 line items: one for each shirt and one for the pants. 

**Line Item:**
In business contexts like sales orders, invoices, or quotes, a "line item" is a single entry that details a specific product or service. For example, one line item might be for "2 apples", while another might be for "1 banana".

**Quantity:**
The "quantity" in this context is the numerical value associated with the number of items in that line item. It indicates how many of the specific product or service are being sold.

**Example:**
Imagine a sales order for a customer. One line item might be for "20 boxes of chocolates". In this case, the "quantity" for that line item is 20, representing the number of boxes of chocolates included in that specific line.

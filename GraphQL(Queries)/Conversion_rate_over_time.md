Bulk GraphQL query to retrieve relevant data for your conversion rate analysis:

```
mutation {
  bulkOperationRunQuery(
    query: """
    {
      shop {
        id
        orders(first: 250, query: "created_at:>=2025-04-01 created_at:<=2025-05-01") {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              createdAt
              cart {
                id
                createdAt
                updatedAt
              }
              checkout {
                id
                completedAt
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    """
  ) {
    bulkOperation {
      id
      status
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

#### Explanation:
**Date Range:** The query filters orders from April 1, 2025, to May 1, 2025, using `created_at:>=2025-04-01 created_at:<=2025-05-01`. Adjust the date range as needed.

**Orders Data:** The query fetches orders, which include cart and checkout information. This allows you to derive:

**Sessions with Cart Additions:** Check for orders with a `cart` object where `cart.createdAt` exists.

**Sessions that Reached Checkout:** Look for orders where `checkout.id exists`, indicating the checkout process was initiated.

**Sessions that Completed Checkout:** Filter for orders where `checkout.completedAt` is not null, indicating a completed purchase.

**Bulk Operation:** Using `bulkOperationRunQuery`, the query handles large datasets asynchronously, as Shopifyâ€™s API limits synchronous requests. The `first: 250` parameter ensures manageable chunks, but the bulk operation will process all matching records.

**Post-Processing:** After retrieving the JSONL file (via the `url` field once the bulk operation completes), youâ€™ll need to process the data:

 - Group orders by day using `createdAt`.
 - Count unique sessions (approximated via unique `cart.id` or `checkout.id`).
 - Calculate the metrics for each day based on the presence of `cart`, `checkout`, and `checkout.completedAt`.
